# SDC--Simple-Lane-detection
- Identifying lanes of the road is important to keep the vehicle in the constraints of the lane, it acts as a guiding reference to know the direction of steering the vehicle. It is a challenging task because of the varying road conditions. - This module will describe the various methods that can be used for lane detection using Python and OpenCV.

# Introduction
- Lane detection can be implemented using various methods that might include Simple operations such as: Color thresholding, Edge detection Then Hough transform. That implementation has many flaws, such as the presence of image distortion, and the inability to accurately measure the lane curvature.
